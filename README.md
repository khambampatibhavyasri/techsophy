# Smart Auto-Scaler â€“ Multi-Tier Forecast-Based Auto Scaling

A complete AI-driven auto-scaling simulation for cloud-native applications. This project forecasts system metrics and automatically adjusts resources across multiple tiers (App + DB) based on predicted demand, anomalies, and scaling rules.

---

##  Features

âœ… Simulated monitoring of key metrics (CPU, RPS, DB Latency)  
âœ… Time Series Forecasting using [Facebook Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)  
âœ… Rule-based auto-scaling logic with anomaly detection and cooldown  
âœ… Multi-tier architecture with independent scaling for App & DB  
âœ… Visual performance metrics saved as PNG  
âœ… Clean modular design â€“ ready for real-world extensions

## Architecture

```
[Monitoring] â†’ [Prediction] â†’ [Decision Engine] â†’ [Scaling Executor]
```

Modules:
- `monitoring.py` â†’ Generates time-series metrics (CPU, latency)
- `predictor.py` & `predictor_db.py` â†’ Forecast CPU and DB latency
- `decision_engine.py` â†’ Detects bottlenecks, decides scaling
- `scaling_executor.py` â†’ Logs simulated scaling actions
- `autoscaler.py` â†’ Runs the pipeline in a loop

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install prophet pandas matplotlib numpy schedule
```

> Tip: For Windows/macOS, use `cmdstanpy` backend for Prophet

```bash
pip install cmdstanpy
```

### 2. Start Auto-Scaler

```bash
python autoscaler.py
```

- Runs every 5 minutes
- Simulates metrics, forecasts, makes decisions
- Outputs saved to: `multi_tier_metrics_plot.png`
