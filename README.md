# 📈 Smart Auto-Scaler – Multi-Tier Forecast-Based Auto Scaling

A complete AI-driven auto-scaling simulation for cloud-native applications. This project forecasts system metrics and automatically adjusts resources across multiple tiers (App + DB) based on predicted demand, anomalies, and scaling rules.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Simulated monitoring of key metrics (CPU, RPS, DB Latency)  
✅ Time Series Forecasting using [Facebook Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)  
✅ Rule-based auto-scaling logic with anomaly detection and cooldown  
✅ Multi-tier architecture with independent scaling for App & DB  
✅ Visual performance metrics saved as PNG  
✅ Clean modular design – ready for real-world extensions

---

## 🧠 Architecture

```
[Monitoring] → [Prediction] → [Decision Engine] → [Scaling Executor]
```

Modules:
- `monitoring.py` → Generates time-series metrics (CPU, latency)
- `predictor.py` & `predictor_db.py` → Forecast CPU and DB latency
- `decision_engine.py` → Detects bottlenecks, decides scaling
- `scaling_executor.py` → Logs simulated scaling actions
- `autoscaler.py` → Runs the pipeline in a loop

## 🧪 How to Run

### 1. 📦 Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install prophet pandas matplotlib numpy schedule
```

> ✅ Tip: For Windows/macOS, use `cmdstanpy` backend for Prophet

```bash
pip install cmdstanpy
```

### 2. 🚀 Start Auto-Scaler

```bash
python autoscaler.py
```

- Runs every 5 minutes
- Simulates metrics, forecasts, makes decisions
- Outputs saved to: `multi_tier_metrics_plot.png`
